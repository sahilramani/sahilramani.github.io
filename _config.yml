# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,

# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Welcome to my digital home. I'm a game developer and software engineer by day and 
  an avid gamer, amateur photographer by night. I've recently adopted the cutest 
  Swiss Shepherd and if I'm not writing code, I'm probably training her or hiking 
  in the park with her and my beautiful wife.

    Welcome to my digital home. I'm a game developer and software engineer by day and an avid gamer, amateur photographer by night. 
    I've recently adopted the cutest Swiss Shepherd and if I'm not writing code, I'm probably training her or hiking in the park with her and my beautiful wife.
    I'm using this website to jot my ideas down, experiment and see what comes out of them. A lot of my projects are half baked and probably don't work as well as expected, but hey, it's a learning experience.
