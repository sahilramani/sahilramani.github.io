Welcome to my digital home. I'm a game developer and software engineer by day and an avid gamer, amateur photographer by night. I've recently adopted the cutest Swiss Shepherd and if I'm not writing code, I'm probably training her or hiking in the park with her and my beautiful wife.

I'm using this website to jot my ideas down, experiment and see what comes out of them. A lot of my projects are half baked and probably don't work as well as expected, but hey, it's a learning experience.
