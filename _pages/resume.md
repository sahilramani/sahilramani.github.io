## Summary

I'm a graphics programer and machine learning specialist with over 15 years of experience, including 12 years shipping AAA games and game engines, including 4 years leading R&D teams. I've pioneered several workflows combining ML & real time graphics, including a 3D Reconstruction pipeline for autonomous vehicle simulation, an ML enhanced terrain generator for Unity Muse and neural rendering augmentation technologies at Unity Technologies. I've also led research teams of up to 5 engineers, building experimental technology used on a number of games. I specialize in bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical, user-friendly implementations, with a particular focus on real time performance and visual quality.
